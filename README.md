# Simpsons-network-analysis
Analysing the Simpsons network with graphs and statistics with R

this code and csv were made together with 4 more classmates, for a data analysis work in R for college.

The original dataset was collected in https://github.com/iainrj/SimpsonsNetwork, but we made a lot of changes, filtering our dataset with only characters that appeared in more than 10 episodes. After, we worked with a dataset with target and source by the names (replacing the Id column by the name column, this way we can use only one dataset) of all characters who continued in the dataset.
